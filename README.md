# SilentAssist

## Context-Aware AI Agent for Autonomous Android Task Management

### Problem Statement
Smartphone users repeatedly perform small but essential actions such as muting notifications during study hours, closing distracting apps at night, managing connectivity settings, and clearing unnecessary notifications. These tasks are context-dependent, repetitive, and often forgotten.

### Solution Overview
SilentAssist is an AI-powered Android agent built using Droidrun’s Agent Framework that autonomously manages small but important tasks by observing contextual signals like time, app usage, and notification patterns.

### Key Features
- Context-aware micro-task automation
- Autonomous decision making
- Background execution
- Action transparency through logs

### Agent Workflow
1. Observe Android context  
2. Decide required action  
3. Execute Android automation  
4. Log the outcome  

### Technology Stack
